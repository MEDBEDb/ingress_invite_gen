ingress_invite_gen - Ingress #invite code generator in Ruby.
==================

# Ingress invite code generator (joke)
Here is a little ruby script i wrote for simulation generation of ingress invite codes..

In order to try it out you must have installed Ruby version 1.9.3-p194 or higher, 
also must have active_support gems installed. 

#Simply run “ruby ingress1.rb”. 

#The actual codes will not work, yet LOL 
Thought the form is adequate .. you can work on addin a proxy and validator .. divide and conquer :D

Have phun:)
